            <h1>3.3.6 Natural Ventilation</h1>
            <p>Natural ventilation may be modeled for a thermal zone in the proposed design when the following
                conditions are met:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Outside air intake from natural ventilation systems shall not be less than the minimum required
                    outdoor air ventilation rates during occupied times in the proposed building model.
                </li>
                <li>Controls for cooling system operation and availability of natural ventilation are automatic.</li>
                <li>Rating authority approves of the proposed procedure.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>In the case when the thermal zone does not have a cooling system in the proposed design but has a
                cooling system in the baseline design:</strong> The thermal zone in the proposed design is modeled with
                no cooling when the natural ventilation system maintains temperature. For periods when the space
                temperature is greater than the cooling setpoint, a cooling system like the one for the baseline
                building is assumed to operate to maintain temperature. The fans in this simulated system cycle with
                loads.</p>
            <p><strong>In the case where the thermal zone has a cooling system:</strong> In the case where the thermal
                zone has an installed cooling system in the proposed design, the fans are required to operate when
                natural ventilation is insufficient to meet cooling or outdoor air ventilation loads. The cooling system
                comes on when natural ventilation is insufficient to maintain the temperature setpoint.</p>
            <p>The corresponding thermal zone in the baseline building is not modeled with natural ventilation. In the
                baseline building, the fans are required to run constantly during occupied periods, and cycle with loads
                during unoccupied periods, same as the proposed building. The baseline building HVAC system provides
                cooling to maintain thermostat setpoint.</p>
            <p>The infiltration rate for the proposed building will be as designed. If natural ventilation is modeled as
                an increased infiltration rate, it will be specified through two inputs: “Infiltration through building
                envelope” and “Infiltration as a result of automatically controlled natural ventilation system”.
                Infiltration as a result of automatically controlled natural ventilation is not modeled for the baseline
                building.</p>
            <p>Outputs for the proposed building with natural ventilation need to demonstrate that minimum outdoor air
                requirements are being met during all occupied hours.</p>
