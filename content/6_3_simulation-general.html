                <p><strong>Section 11.4.1:</strong> The simulation program must be approved by the adopting authority
                    and
                    have the following capabilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explicitly support simulation methods, systems, and components listed in Section 11.4.1.1, such
                        as
                        hourly variations in occupancy, lighting power, miscellaneous equipment power, thermostat set
                        points, and HVAC system operation, defined separately for each day of the week and holidays;
                        thermal
                        mass effects; ten or more thermal zones; part-load performance curves for mechanical equipment;

                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the simulation program must be tested according to ASHRAE Standard 140, except for
                    Sections
                    7 and 8, and the results must be furnished by the software provider (Section 11.4.1.4). In 90.1
                    2019,
                    the relevant reporting requirements were expanded and clarified as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The test results and modeler reports must be posted on a publicly available website and include

                        test results of the simulation program along with the results of the other simulation programs
                        included in ASHRAE Standard 140, Annexes B8 and B16.

                    <li>The modeler report in Standard 140, Annex A2, Attachment A2.7 must be completed for results
                        exceeding the maximum or falling below the minimum of the reference values or for missing

                        (Section
                        6).
                    </li>
                    <li>Section 12.4.1.4.3 specifies that the testing shall be performed for the version of the

                <ol>
                    <li>Simulation tool name and version is reported in the Energy Model Information section on the
                        General
                        Information tab of the Compliance Form.
                    </li>
                    <li>If AHJ/RA has the list of simulation programs, verify that the simulation program used for the
                        project is on the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>If AHJ/RA does not have the list of simulation programs, verify that the simulation program
                        meets
                        the relevant requirements of 90.1 summarized above. The footnote below includes tools listed on
                        the
                        IRS website approved for 179d modeling analysis. An individual AHJ/RA may allow only some of
                        these
                        tools, a subset of versions for each program, or simulation tools not listed on the IRS website.
                    </li>
                    <li>If it is determined that the simulation program used on the project is not approved, it is
                        recommended that the issue is resolved before proceeding with other checks described in the
                        manual.
                        Alternatively, only the checks that do not involve verifying simulation inputs or outputs should
                        be
                        completed.

                <h5>Review Tips</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Weather file used in the simulation is reported in the General Information tab of the compliance
                        Form.
                    </li>
                    <li>If AHJ/RA has pre-approved weather files that must be used for specific project locations,
                        confirm
                        that the weather file listed in the Compliance Form and in the model is approved.
                    </li>
                    <li>If AHJ/RA does not have pre-approved weather files, as a general rule projects should use a
                        weather
                        file for the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) station closest to the project site. In areas
                        with
                        large elevation changes or microclimates, the closest station may be at a significantly
                        different
                        elevation and therefore have different weather or psychrometric characteristics or may be in a
                        different microclimate. In such cases, a weather station at similar elevation and latitude or
                        similar microclimate may be a better fit.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the weather station is determined, TMY2, TMY3, or TMYx data files for the selected station
                        should be used (for projects located in the United States). TMYx data reflects more recent
                        weather
                        patterns compared to TMY3 and TMY2 data. Alternative weather data sources, such as those
                        accounting
                        for expected climate change, may be allowed with sufficient supporting documentation.
                    </li>

                        the
                        design documents. In addition, check that the classification of the project floor areas reported

                        described
                        as “new construction”, “alteration” and “modeled existing to remain – no alteration” and

                        PRM
                        projects and, if the answer is “No”, PRM projects must follow 90.1 Section G3.3 instead of

                        <li>Gross floor area reported in the design documents is based on the definition in the 2015
                            IBC,
                            which differs from the 90.1 – 2016 definition (both are quoted below). ECB and PRM do not
                            specify how building area should be inputted into the model, e.g. whether it should be based
                            on
                            the inside perimeter of the exterior walls (based on the IBC definition), or the outside
                            perimeter of the exterior walls (90.1 definition), so it may be modeled either way.

                    <li>Unmet load hours (UMLH) are reported in Table 1 on the Compliance Calculations tab of the

                        Form.
                    </li>
                    <li>The prescribed limits should be enforced for most projects because high UMLHs are often due to
                        simulation errors that may have a high impact on the compliance outcome. The higher the UMLHs in
                        the
                        proposed design compared to the baseline (budget) model effectively means that even though the
                        two
                        models have the same thermostat setpoints, the actual space temperatures in the proposed design

                <h5>Review Tips</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>The PCI and PCIt calculations are automated in the Compliance Calculations tab of the Compliance
                        form based on the simulation results for the baseline and proposed design. However, the
                        compliance
                        outcome is strongly influenced by whether the baseline energy cost is properly separated into
                        regulated (BBREC) and unregulated (BBUEC) components, thus the review should focus on verifying
                        that
                        the regulated versus unregulated loads are identified correctly on the Compliance Calculations
                        tab.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reporting regulated load as unregulated makes Appendix G less stringent. Review Table 2 of the
                        Compliance Tab to verify that regulated loads are not erroneously listed as unregulated. The
                        table
                        has default regulated/unregulated assignments for common end uses. Review any over-written
                        defaults
                        (these will be shown in brown font in the “Unregulated?” column of the table).
