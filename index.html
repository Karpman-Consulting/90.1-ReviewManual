            <p>This site is intended to be a reference manual for the Appendix G Performance Rating Method (PRM) of ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2022 (Standard 90.1-2022). The PRM can be used to demonstrate compliance with the standard and to rate the energy efficiency of commercial and high-rise residential buildings with designs that exceed the requirements of Standard 90.1. Use of the PRM for demonstrating compliance with Standard 90.1 was a new feature of ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2016 (Standard 90.1-2016). The procedures and processes described in the PRM reference manual (PRM-RM) are designed to provide consistency and accuracy by filling in gaps and providing additional details needed by users of the PRM. Note that this document has been created independently from ASHRAE and Standing Standard Project Committee (SSPC) 90.1 and is neither sanctioned nor approved by either of those entities.</p>

            <p>Interpretations to Standard 90.1-2022 Code requirements can be found <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines/standards-interpretations">out here</a>. Users can also request official interpretations to code requirements <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-forms--procedures/how-to-request-an-interpretation">out here</a>. In cases where the official interpretation conflicts with interpretations provided by the PRM-RM, the official interpretations should be used.</p>
